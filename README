MAPaint is an interactive application to manually segment, "paint" 3D
voxel data. This is a X11/Motif based application providing very fast
access to section views through the data volume. The software allows
the user to define arbitrary regions of the 3D space (termed domains)
by manual and semi-automatic delineation. In any session up to 32
domains can be defined simultaneously which are saved to independent
files. Domains are full 3D image objects that can be manipulated
with the woolz libraries and command line tools.
