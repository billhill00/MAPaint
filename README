MAPaint is an interactive application to manually segment, "paint" 3D voxel
data. This is an X11/Motif based application providing very fast access to
section views through the data volume. The software allows the user to define
arbitrary regions of the 3D space - termed domains - by manual and semi-
automatic delineation. In any session up to 32 domains can be defined
simultaneously which are saved to independent files. Domains are full 3D
image objects that can be manipulated with the woolz libraries and command
line tools.
